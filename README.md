                         > Search Rooms for their details
                         > back to main menu 

2.Customer Check-Ins

3.Availability of Rooms

4.Searching history of customer 

5.Customer Check-outs

This the project which I and my 2 fellow mates have built using C++ language and its concepts like file handling, functions, etc.
This is the poject out of the knowledge we gained while learning C++ 
To run this code on your pcs you need to download borland C++ or you can make some changes in your code and can run it on VSCode too.
